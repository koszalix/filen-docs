# Introduction

The Filen CLI provides a set of useful tools for interacting with the cloud:

-   [Accessing your Filen Drive](/docs/cli/access-filen-drive) in a stateless environment or [interactive mode](/docs/cli/access-filen-drive#interactive-mode)
-   [Syncing](/docs/cli/syncing) locations with the cloud (just like the Desktop app)
-   Mounting a [network drive](/docs/cli/network-drive-mounting)
-   Running a [WebDAV mirror server](/docs/cli/webdav-and-s3-server#webdav-server) of your [personal drive](/docs/cli/webdav-and-s3-server#single-user), or multiple drives in [proxy mode](/docs/cli/webdav-and-s3-server#proxy-mode)
-   Running an [S3 mirror server](/docs/cli/webdav-and-s3-server#s3-server)

## Installation and updates

You can download the latest binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/FilenCloudDienste/filen-cli/releases/latest), or execute the install script (Linux and macOS):

```
curl -sL https://filen.io/cli.sh | bash
```

Docker images are also available as [filen/cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/filen/cli) (see [below](#using-docker)).

The Filen CLI includes an automatic updater that checks for a new release every time the CLI is invoked
(after checking for updates, it will not check again for the next 10 minutes).
Invoke the CLI with the `--skip-update` flag to skip checking for updates, or use the `--force-update` flag to check for updates even if it was recently checked.
Use the `--auto-update` flag to skip the confirmation prompt and update automatically (the CLI will still abort after updating).

You can always install any version using `filen install <version>`, `filen install latest` or `filen install canary`.

The CLI is also available as an NPM package, which can be installed with `npm install --global @filen/cli` and then invoked as `filen`. The NPM repository always contains the latest canary releases (see below).

### Canary releases

If you want to be among the first to try out new features and fixes, you can enable canary releases,
which are early releases meant for a subset of users to test before they are declared as stable.
To enable or disable canary releases, invoke the CLI with the command `filen canary`.

## Usage

Global flags:

-   `--help`, `-h`: display usage information
-   `--verbose`, `-v`: display additional information
-   `--quiet`, `-q`: hide things like progress bars and additional logs
-   `--log-file <file>`: write logs to a file

For detailed information on how to use the CLI features, see the respective documentation pages.

### Data directory

The data directory is where configuration files, credentials, cache etc. are stored and read from. By default, it is `%APPDATA%/filen-cli` (Windows), `~/Library/Application Support/filen-cli` (macOS) or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/filen-cli` or `~/.config/filen-cli` (Unix). If there is a directory named `.filen-cli` at the home directory `~`, it is used instead (for instance, the install script installs to this location). You can overwrite the location using the `--data-dir` flag or the `FILEN_CLI_DATA_DIR` environment variable.

## Using Docker

You can run the CLI in a Docker container using the [`filen/cli`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/filen/cli) image.

For example, to run a WebDAV/S3 server in a container, you can use a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) file similar to this:

```yaml
services:
    filen-webdav:
        image: filen/cli:latest
        ports:
            - 80:80
        command: >
            --email <...>
            --password <...>
            webdav
            --w-user <...>
            --w-password <...>
```
